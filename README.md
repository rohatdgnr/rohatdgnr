Hello,

Hello,
I’m Rohat Doğaner. With a background in electronic communication technologies, I developed a strong analytical mindset and technical problem-solving skills early on. In recent years, I have focused heavily on software development and have been continuously improving myself in both backend and frontend technologies.

On the backend side, I actively work with Java, Spring Boot, Postgres, MySQL, RESTful API development, JWT security, layered architecture, Mikro/Logo ERP integrations, and scheduled synchronization services.
On the frontend, I have experience with Next.js, React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and responsive component-based UI development.
I also manage deployment and infrastructure processes using Nginx, SSL configuration, Windows & Linux server management, and NSSM service operations.

Participating in real-world projects and developing end-to-end systems has significantly strengthened my technical skill set while improving my communication, teamwork, and project management abilities.

My career goal is clear: to specialize fully in software development, become a strong full-stack developer, and combine my background in electronics with software expertise to create innovative and efficient solutions. Every project I work on and every challenge I overcome motivates me to grow further.

I continue to improve myself every day, and I firmly believe that each step I take brings me closer to my goals. Knowing that I can seek support when needed is also something I truly value.
